MUV uses [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) as style library.

To style MUV components or create your own, just import MUV like the follow:

`import styled, { Text, Button } from 'muv';`

⧩

Remember to import a component from the list available on this documentation:

[ATOMS](/#atoms) | [MOLECULES](/#molecules) | [ORGANISMS](/#organisms) | [TEMPLATES](/#templates)

⧩

You can create your own component this way:

`const MyComponent = style.p`` `

More documentation can be found on [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/).

There are another way to style MUV components, is using a Theme prop that can  be passad directly or through a ThemeProvider.

You can do this importing the ThemeProvider from MUV like this:

`import { ThemeProvider } from 'muv'`

Then passing it arround your application, like the Provider from Redux.
